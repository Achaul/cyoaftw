// ── NPC TAGS AND FACT SELECTOR ───────────────────────────────────────
// One closed tag vocabulary shared by memories and facts. A reply is steered by
// "wanted" tags worked out from what the player chose or typed plus the
// situation; the selector then sends only the few records that match, inside a
// small budget, instead of everything the NPC knows. Nothing here calls the AI.
//   topic tags       what the line is about (work, money, family, food, ...)
//   relation tags    how the NPC stands to the player or others (kin, friend, ...)
//   memory kinds     what happened between them (told, gift, insult, debt, ...)
//   situation tags   the moment (time:night, hurt, fight-here, mood:*)
// Records are { id, tags[], text, weight, always }. A record scores
//   3 x topic tags matched + 1.5 x situation tags matched + 3 x keyword hits + weight
// and is only sent when it matches something (or the line is generic and the
// record has weight); `always` records (a marriage rule, what was already told)
// are always sent. When nothing matches, no facts are sent and the reply prompt
// tells the speaker to say they do not know rather than invent.

//   1. ROLE: what they do. Keepers, priests and healers are settled and civil,

//   2. SPECIES: the confirmed cultures (orcs love a fight, goblins are sneaky
//      and fear magic, lizardfolk guard territory, kobolds are timid, dragonborn
//      are proud). Realm species are left alone.
//   3. SOCIETY (second pass, once the social sheet exists): rank, status and
//      standing. A feral kobold is hostile, a bonded one is not; an orc
//      chieftain is bold, an outcast is wary; an oathless dragonborn is on edge.
//   4. ZONE: hostile areas raise the odds of hostile and aggressive for
//      everyone except staff and guards.
//   5. MOBS: skeletons are always aggressive, rats are skittish (or feral in a
//      hostile area), ghosts are on edge.
// Town keeps a small pool of troublemakers (rowdy patrons, drifters, thieves).
// Weights are relative; keys not listed count as 0.
